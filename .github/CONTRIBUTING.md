### Guidelines

There are a number of guidelines considered when reviewing Pull Requests to be merged. *This is by no means an exhaustive list, but here are some things to consider before/while submitting your ideas.*

- Everything in the project should be generally useful for the majority of users. Don't let that stop you if you've got a good concept though, as your idea still might be a great addition.
- Everything should follow our linter rules as closely as possible, and should pass linting even if you must disable a rule for a single line.
